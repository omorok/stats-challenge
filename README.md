# Python Stats Challenge

The challenge is to create a program that computes some basic statistics on a collection of small positive integers. You can assume all values will be less than 1,000.

Implement this challenge in whatever programming language
best highlights your skills. Also, please supply a README with
details on how to setup and run your application.

### Requirements

The DataCapture object accepts numbers and returns an object for querying
statistics about the inputs. Specifically, the returned object supports
querying how many numbers in the collection are less than a value, greater
than a value, or within a range.
Here’s the program skeleton in Python to explain the structure:
```sh
capture = DataCapture()
capture.add(3)
capture.add(9)
capture.add(3)
capture.add(4)
capture.add(6)
stats = capture.build_stats()
stats.less(4) # should return 2 (only two values 3, 3 are less than 4)
stats.between(3, 6) # should return 4 (3, 3, 4 and 6 are between 3 and 6)
stats.greater(4) # should return 2 (6 and 9 are the only two values greater
than 4)
```


### Challenge Conditions
* You cannot import a library that solves it instantly
* The methods add(), less(), greater(), and between() should have
constant time O(1)
* The method build_stats() can be at most linear O(n)
* Apply the best practices you know
* Share a public repo with your project



## For usage example

Install [Python3+](https://www.python.org/) before run and get the source from:


```sh
git clone https://github.com/omorok/stats-challenge.git
```

to run the challenge run the code below
```sh
python3 main.py
```

## For testing purposes
If you need to add some test cases, be free to edit the file **data_test_cases.py** within **/tests** folder.
The file estructure shuld look like this:
```sh
test_cases = [
    ([3, 9, 3, 4, 6], {'less(4)': 2, 'between(3,6)': 4, 'greater(4)': 2}),
    ([3, 9, 3, 4, 6, 5, 6, 2], {'less(4)': 3, 'between(4,6)': 4, 'greater(4)': 4}),
    ([3, 9, 3, 4, 6, 5, 6, 2], {'greater(-1)': 'Input value error: value out of range or different integer type.'}),
    ([3, 9, 3, 4, 6, 5, 6, 2], {'greater(1001)': 'Input value error: value out of range or different integer type.'})
    ]
```
The firt parámeter should be the numbers you want to add to the test cases, and the second argument should be a dictionary where the keys are the are method names, and the values are the corresponding values expected by each test case.

### Install Pytest before any testing run. 
```sh
pip install pytest==7.1.2
```
to run test execute the lines below

```sh
cd tests
pytest
```

# NOTE:
I did every feedback change provided but I need to say that I interpreted the following feedback change requirement:

*"Los test están muy acoplados, sería bueno separarrlos por clases..."*

in the way I need to decouple the data test inputs for rehuse among the clases tested and make a test for each class involved, but I feel that the principle of private methods tested through piublic ones should be priority and my previous implementation reflected that. That beign said, thanks again for the feedback.
